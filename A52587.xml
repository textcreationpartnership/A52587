            <title>The art of gunnery Wherein is described the true way to make all sorts of gunpowder, guu-match [sic], the art of shooting in great and small ordnance: excellent ways to take heights, depths, distances, accessible, or inaccessible, either single or divers distances at one operation: to draw the map or plot of any city, town, castle, or other fortified place. To make divers sorts of artificiall fire-works, both for war and recreation, also to cure all such wounds that are curable, which may chance to happen by gunpowder or fire-works. This treatise is composed for the help of all such gunners and others, that have charge of artillery, and are not well versed in arithmetick and geometry : all the rules and directions in this book, being framed both with and without the help of arithmetick.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>IT is certain, that the beſt Powder would be that in which is moſt Saltpeter, if a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:38529:14"/>
ſmaller quantity of Sulpher and Cole, then but once ſo much of either of them, as to be one ſixt part to the quantity of Peter, might ſerve; which compoſition I will call 6—1—1, meaning ſix times ſo much Peter, as one time Sulpher, and one time Cole. But leſſe Sulpher and Cole, as 7— 1—1, the Sulpher and Cole are not able to perform and execute the office as they ought to do; that is to ſay, to be on fire quickly, and ſet the Saltpeter on fire, and to maintain the ſame fire, until it be wholly reſolved into fire; therefore no more Sulpher and Cole to ſo much Peter, would be to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: Certainly if Gunpowder were only made of Peter, that would be more ſtrong then Powder made of Peter, Cole and Brimſtone; but becauſe the ſaid Peter is not apt to burn in a flame quickly, as Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone will do, nor maintain the flame until all is conſumed, as Cole will do, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is needful to adde Sulpher and Cole thereunto, and onely ſuch a quantity as will juſt ſerve turn: In Powder 5—1—1, by experience is found more Sulpher and Cole then needeth; yet it is good not only to make Powder of 5—1—1, which is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:38529:14"/>
Musket Powder, but alſo of 4—1—1, which ſerveth beſt for great Ordnance. Now the reaſon why this laſt ſort ſhould ſerve better for Ordnance, then Piſtol Powder of 6—1—1, which is the ſtrongeſt of all, I will ſhew in the next Chapter.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THe reaſon why Canon Powder is beſt for Ordnance, is becauſe it taketh up a greater room in the Cylinder of the Piece, then Piſtol Powder; for in taking up much room, it hath the greater fortification of Mettal about it, to keep it from breaking the Piece: Suppoſe a Saker requireth four pound of great Powder for her loading, and I would know how much Piſtol pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is equal in ſtrength to four pound of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:38529:15"/>
Canon powder, trying by an Engine made of purpoſe to try powder, I finde three pound to be of like force: you may eaſily conceive that the three pound hath but three quarters of the Mettal of the Piece, to keep it from breaking, when as four pound hath one quarter more Mettal then the other three had.</p>
                     <p>To make it more plain, if you look into the ſecond Chapter you ſhall finde, That the firſt powder of all, was made of juſt ſo much Saltpeter, as of Cole, and of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, called 1—1—1; if you had ſuch powder, and alſo one of the old Pieces made in thoſe days, as ſome of them may yet be ſeen in many Cities of <hi>England,</hi> you could not load them with any other pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der but they would break. You ſhall hear what I have done; I made ſuch kinde of powder as 1—1—1, and tryed how much of that powder was in ſtrength to one pound of Piſtol powder, being 6—1—1, by an Engine I found three pounds and nine ounces, the Piece was Saker bore of Iron, and the thickneſs of the Mettal about the Chamber, was two inches in thickneſs; I loaded the Piece with four pound of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:38529:15"/>
weak powder, which filled the Cylinder of the bore nine inches juſt; which nine inches in length, and two in thickneſs about the Chamber, is Two hundred twenty five inches of Mettal about the powder, near Forty ſeven pounds weight, at this adventure the Piece came off ſafe; but being loaden with one pound and a quarter of fine powder almoſt, which filled the bore but two inches and three quarters, and had to its fortification but Sixty eight inches and three quarters, which is in weight fifteen pounds, at the diſcharge of the Gun, it brake in divers pieces: This was done in <hi>Deriton,</hi> upon the 17 of <hi>March, Anno Dom.</hi> 1644. as many people can witneſs.</p>

Tombs, or deſolate Caves, where rain can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come in, and alſo Charnel houſes; The beſt of all is made of beaſts dung converted into earth, in Stables, or in Dunghils, of a long time not uſed; and it is requiſite, what dung ſoever it be, that by long continuance of time it be well reſolved into earth, and all the moiſtneſs dryed up: When you have occaſion to make of this dung, or earth, a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Saltpeter, it will be neceſſary for you to provide many Cauldrons, Furna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Barrels and Tubs, and wood for fire; theſe Barrels muſt be ſet on end upon a Form, the top being taken out, and near the bottom a hole bored with an Augre; you muſt cover the inſide of thoſe holes with an earthen Porringer, and ſtop the outſide with Taps; then fill up the Barrel with the ſaid earth within a ſpan of the brim, and remember that the earth about the ſaid veſſels ſhould be rammed down, yet that part of the earth that lieth in the midſt of the veſſel, may lie looſe; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards pour a Bucket of clean water upon the earth, and after that pour another, not failing to do ſo till all the earth within the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:38529:16"/>
Tub be well moiſtened, which ought to continue thus one day and night, the water a full hands breadth above the earth; then pull out the Taps or Spiggots out of the holes in the veſſel, and let the water drop out of that veſſel into another, being ſet under it: When you ſee no more water will drop, empty the undermoſt veſſel again into the uppermoſt, out of which it did drop, and out of the ſame let it drop again, ſo long and ſo much as it can; this water when it hath dropped twice, is called water of Foot, and alſo the waſh of earth, and muſt be ſaved by it ſelf: After this pour other clean water upon the very ſame mould in the Tub, and when the ſaid wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath dropped out of the higher veſſel into the Tub that ſtands under, take all the earth out of the upper veſſel, and fill it with more of the ſaid earth, then pour upon this earth in the veſſel, the water as you made firſt, called water of Foot, and waſh of earth, ſuffering it to drop through the ſame into the undermoſt Tub, ſtanding under the earth Tub, ſo often until it be ſo ſalt as to bite your tongue, and that an egg will ſwim on the top of the water: The

firſt water being brought to this perfection, pour the ſecond water upon the ſaid earth, or other earth, that it may by often paſſing through be of as biting a taſte as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, as alſo able to bear up an egg: Now this ſecond water being very ſtrong, muſt be boiled in a Cauldron, and after it hath well boiled, abate the fire under the Caul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, until you have taken off it all the ſcum, which muſt be ſaved in a Pot; then preſently make a good fire, to cauſe it to boil again with ſpeed, and as the water in the Cauldron diminiſheth, ſcum the ſaid water, and keep the ſaid ſcum: When the ſcum ſhall be thick, hard, and of a French Ruſſet colour, take ſome water out of the Cauldron, and let it drop upon a piece of Iron, for if the water be boiled enough, the drops of water will congeal upon the ſame Iron, but if they do not congeal, it is a ſign it may abide the fire longer; when its boiled, as you may perceive by the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named ſigns, take it from the fire, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, becauſe it is the Peter-water: Now when you have made an end of boiling the ſecond water, you muſt boil and ſcum the firſt water (named water of Foot, or waſh

                     <p n="11">11. If Gunpowder burned upon a board ſhall black the ſame, it is a ſign that there is overmuch Cole in that powder.</p>

                     <p>A Gunner ought to be skilful in Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick and Geometry, to the end he may be able through his knowledge in thoſe Arts, to meaſure heights, depths, breadths and length, and to draw the plot of any piece of ground, to make Mines, Countermines, Artificial Fireworks, Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piars, Baskets of earth, and ſuch like things which are uſed in the time of War, to be made for offenſive or defenſive ſervice.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="38" facs="tcp:38529:30"/>A Gunner that hath a charge, ought to have in readineſs all neceſſary things for his Artillery, theſe are Wheels, Axeltrees, Ladles, Rammers, Sheepskins to make Spunges, Gunpowder, Shot, Tampions, Chain ſhot, Croſs bar-ſhot, Canvas, or ſtrong paper (to make Cartredges) Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, artificial Torches, dark Lanthorns, a gin to mount and diſmount Guns, Hand-ſpikes, Coyns, Budge-barrels to carry powder, and Baskets to carry ſhot to your Piece; he is always, when leaſure will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, to chooſe good Matchcords, to arm his Linſtock wherewith he muſt give fire.</p>
                     <p>A Gunner ſhould never be without a Ruler and Compaſſes to meaſure the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter or Bore of every Piece; and alſo the length of the Cylinder within, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to fit her with a ſhot, and proportion a charge.</p>
                     <p>A Gunner ought to know the names, length, weight and fortification of every Piece about the Chamber (that is, ſo far as the Piece is loaden with powder) and be able to tell readily how much Gunpowder is a due charge for every Piece, what ſhot is fit, how many Matroſſes muſt attend the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:38529:30"/>
ſame upon ſervice, how many Horſes or Oxen will draw the ſaid Piece, and in caſe they cannot be had, how many men will ſerve: And laſtly, he ſhould know how to charge and diſcharge Gunner like.</p>
                     <p>A Gunner ought not at any time to beat up the head of his powder barrels with an iron tool, but with a wooden mallet, which can never fire the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Every Gunner before he beginneth to ſhoot, ought to conſider, that a long wad of Hay, or of untwiſted Ropes, will make the ſhot to ſhoot wide of the mark.</p>
                     <p>Every Gunner before he beginneth to ſhoot, ought to conſider, whether the Trunnions be truly placed in the Carriage, whether the Carriage have a true length, whether one wheel be higher or reverſe faſter then the other, whether the plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form whereon the Piece is to do ſervice, be level, or not; if not, to get the ſame a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended: Laſtly, to make clean the plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, that no ſtone or other thing lie for the wheels to run upon, for all theſe things not well obſerved, will cauſe the Piece to erre.</p>
                     <p>Every Gunner before he loadeth his
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:38529:31"/>
Piece, muſt try whether it be true bored or not; if not, he is to proportion his charge according to the thinneſt ſide of the mettal; he muſt take his obſervation at the brich of the Piece, juſt over where he ſhall finde (by his art) where the middle of the bore within the Piece is; by this means he ſhall make a good ſhot, out of a bad Piece.</p>
                     <p>Every Gunner before he makes his ſhot, ought to conſider that if the Piece lye point-blanck, or under mettal, he ought to put in a ſufficient wad after the ſhot, to keep it cloſe to the powder; for if it ſhould not be cloſe, but ſome diſtance between, the Piece would break in the vacant place: but if in caſe you mount your Piece, then put no wad after the ſhot.</p>
                     <p>And one chief thing in the laſt place, to know very well how to diſpart his Piece, be it either true bored, or not true bored, which he may try firſt.</p>

                        <p>There is much about ſeven cube inches of iron in one pound; by this rule you may finde 7 thirty times in 216 and 7; you may finde ſeven to be contained in 343, juſt forty nine times, but this rule is not ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as the former, becauſe in ſubtracting ſeven out of 216, you ſhall finde thirty pounds and 6/7 parts, which is too much by the fraction.</p>

                     <p>SUppoſe the height of the ſhot be three inches and three quarters, and the weight ſeven pounds five ounces; I would know what a ſhot of ſixteen pounds would be in height, according to the ſame proportion? Firſt, finde the Cube root of three inches three quarters, which you may do by the Table; then as the ſeven pounds five oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is to the Cube of 3 ¾, ſo ſixteen pounds is to ſuch a Cube, whoſe root is the height of the ſhot ſought for.</p>
                     <p>

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:38529:39"/>
whoſe root being found in the Table, is four inches three quarters, and ſomewhat more: for in the Table, the neareſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to 115, is 107, the juſt Cube of four inches three quarters; and this number 115 exceeding the former by eight, this ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that it is a very ſmall deal higher, ſcarſe one half quarter of an inch: And you may alſo perceive by the laſt rule in the 26 Chapter, that ſeven inches cubical make a pound: now finding this to exceed 107 (the Cube of 4 ¾) eight cubical inches, you may conclude, that it is one pound, and one ſeventh part of a pound heavier then a ſhot of juſt four inches three quarters height.</p>

                     <p>The proportion betwixt iron and ſtone, is as three to eight; ſo that a ſhot of thirty pounds of ſtone, is as big as the like ſhot of eighty pounds iron.</p>
                     <p>The Reader taking theſe proportions into conſideration, and having knowledge in the Art of Arithmetick, may with eaſe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate (if iron ſhot be wanting, and the other to be had) what height and weight either ſhot of lead, braſs or ſtone, ought to be of, to fit any Piece of Ordnance: But for ſuch as are not acquainted with Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick, to calculate theſe proportions, for their help I framed a Table, that doth ſhew the weight of any ſhot of lead, iron and ſtone, from two inches Diameter, to eight inches, dividing every inch into quarters.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="58" facs="tcp:38529:40"/>I do confeſs that ſome ſort of ſtone is much heavier then other; but ſuch as you ought to uſe, ſhould be that which is moſt compact, as Marble, Pibble ſtones alſo may be found which are round, and hard blew ſtone, ſuch as divers Tombs are made of, it being ſomewhat courſer then Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; all theſe to my knowledge are much about that proportion as I have given: But ſuch as is ſoft, as Free-ſtone, and the like, they are not ſo pondrous as the other, nor ſo fit for uſe: Alſo lead, the finer and nearer to tin, the leſs weight it is.</p>
                     <p>You are to note, That in loading your Piece with a ſhot of ſtone, you are not to load the Piece with ſo much powder as you did formerly with iron ſhot, but abate, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the proportion as is between ſtone and iron.</p>

                     <p>THis Chapter or Propoſition is reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved almoſt like the former, for firſt you muſt find the Cube Root of the diameter of the bore of that Peece, whoſe allowance of Powder for a charg you know: and alſo the Diameter of the bore of the Peece, which you would know how much ſhould load, or charge it, then by the Table finde their Cubes, and as the cube of that you doe know, is to the cube of that you know not, ſo the quantity of powder known, is to that ſought for.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Example.</label> A Saker of three inches three quarters diameter of the bore requires foure pound
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:38529:44"/>
what will a Demicannon of ſix inches and an half require? the cube of three and three quarters is 52 and 73 hundred parts of an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and the cube of ſix and a halfe is 274, and 62 hundred parts: Then ſay evermore, as 52.73 (the cube of three and three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) is to 274, and 62 hundred parts, (the Cube of ſix inches and an halfe) ſo foure pound of Powder to load a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, is in proportion to 20 pound 13 ounces the Powder to load a Demicannon. You are likewiſe to underſtand that the Demicannon ſhould be fortified ſo well as the Saker: the cube of the diameter of the Demicannon is 274, of the Saker 52, the weight of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker 1600, what ſhould the weight of the Demicannon be; then ſay as before, as 52 (the cube of the bore of the Saker) is to 274 (the cube of the Demicannon bore) ſo 1600 (the weight of that Saker) is to 8431, the weight that ſuch a Demicannon ſhould be of, that can beare ſuch a proportionable charge, according to the Saker: But ſuppoſe the Demicannon to be no more then 6000 weight, then you muſt multiply 6000 by 20 pound and 13 ounces (the charge already calculated) divide by 8431 the weight, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:38529:44"/>
you ſhall finde 14 pound 13 ounces, which is a ſufficient charge for that Peece: thus you are always to take care of over-loading your Peece, which errour divers run into, when they call a Peece a Demicannon, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently load her, with ſo much, as is allowed for ſuch a Peece ſo named, ſeldome exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, whether the Peece have mettall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, for ſuch a charge; by which miſtake, they ſtand in danger of their own lives, and others too, which are about them; which may eaſily be prevented, as is above decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>To finde whether a Peece of Ordnance be true bored or no.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>YOu muſt provide a Pike-ſtaffe, about a foot longer then the bore of your Peece; and at the end thereof faſten a Rammer head, that will juſt fill all the bore under the touch-hole, and at the other
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:38529:45"/>
end of the ſtaffe you muſt bore a hole, big enough to put thorow a rod of iron, which muſt hang from the ſame; and at the other end of the rod, muſt be made a weight about the bigneſſe of a Saker ſhot, this is done, to make the pike ſtaffe and rammer head, to lye with the ſame part upward, when they are taken out of the Peece, as they did, when the were within the Peece: then you muſt put your Inſtrument, thus prepared, into the Peece; letting the iron ball (that is at the end of the rod, which is put thorow the hole, bored acroſſe the pike ſtaffe) hang perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; then take your priming Iron, or ſome other Bodkin, and put it down the touch-hole, to the rammer head; making a mark therewith, this done, draw out your Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and lay the ſame on a long table, with the Iron ball hanging off the end, perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer: as it did when this Inſtrument was in the Peece, then obſerve whether the marke you made upon the rammer head, when it was in the Peece, be juſt on the upermoſt part of the ſame, if it be; the bore at the Peece lyeth neither to the right, nor left hand; if you finde it a quarter of an inch on the right, or left hand; ſo much lyeth the bore either
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:38529:45"/>
to the right, or left; and the Peece in ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing muſt be ordered &amp; charged accordingly.</p>
                     <p>By this aforeſaid, you may finde whether the bore incline to the right or left: but to know whether it ly alſo upwards and down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and not in the middle, that way: To know this finde the diameter of the Peece at the touch-hole, as is before taught; then take a wire and bend it a little at the very end, that it may catch at the mettall, when you draw it out of the ſaid touch-hole: after this wire is thus prepared, firſt put it in at the touch-hole, till it touch the bottom of the mettall in the Chamber, then holding it in that place, make a mark upon that wire, juſt even with the ſaid touch-hole, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards draw up the wire untill it catch at the mettall on the top of the Chamber, and holding it there make a mark as before; the difference between the two marks is the juſt wideneſſe of the Chamber, and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance betweene the firſt mark, and the end of the wire (having half the diameter of the Chamber of the Peece ſubſtracted from it) will leave halfe of the diameter of the Peece, if the Peece be true bored, but if this number be more then halfe the diameter,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:38529:46"/>
then the bore lyeth too far from the touch-hole, and the upper part of the mettall is thickeſt; but if leſſe, the under part hath moſt mettall.</p>
                     <p>
                        <label>Example.</label> Firſt, I finde the diameter of the Peece to be 12 inches at the touch-hole, then with my wire I finde the bore to be in diameter four inches: to the bottome of the mettall it is ſeven inches and an half; the half of the diameter or bore is two inches: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing added to the diſtance from the ſecond marke on the wire, or ſubſtracted from ſeven inches and an halfe the firſt marke; leaves five inches and an halfe, which is leſſe then halfe of the diameter you firſt took, by half an inch: therefore as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the greateſt part of the mettall is under the bore, and the Peece likeſt to break above, alſo when you make the diſpart for that peece you are to make it halfe an inch ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then before, the like obſervation you muſt have to make it longer, in caſe the mettall be thickeſt in the upper part.</p>
                     <p>Thus I hope I have given reaſonable ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:38529:46"/>
concerning this point, and I am ſure on that manner as was never taught before: the truth is, there was never any way taught before that could performe this thing, the peece lying in its carriage; and how laborious it is to handle a great peece out of a carriage, let Gunners judge: I made two ſuch Inſtruments as are taught by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>William Bourne,</hi> in his Book, called <hi>The Art of ſhooting in great Ordnance, Chap.</hi> 2. but neither I, nor I believe himſelf, could e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver uſe them, when the peece is in its cariage.</p>

                     <p>If the firſt ſhot had ſtruck under the Mark,

then bring the Peece in all points as before to paſſe, marke how mueh of the Diſpart is over the ſtrock of the ſhot, and cut it juſt ſo ſhort, as being at the britch you may diſcern the top of it, the marke on the Baſe ring, and the ſtrock of the ſhot in a right line, when you perceive it is of ſuch a length, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell the peece to the aſſigned marke as at the firſt, then prime and give fire.</p>
                     <p>If the firſt ſhot had ſtruck on the right hand of the Marke, to mend it, you muſt le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell the Peece as formerly, you ſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde the britch of the Peece, obſerve the ſtrock of the ſhot over the Diſpart, that part of the Baſe ring as you at that inſtant looke over in a right line towards the Diſpart, and the ſtrock of the ſhot, ſet up in that place a pin with a little ſoft wax on the Baſe ring, ſo this pin will be in a right line with the Diſpart and ſtrock of the ſhot: this being done, levell your Peece to the Marke aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by this pin and the Diſpart, and without queſtion you will make a faire ſhot.</p>
                     <p>For when you levell by the mettall of the baſe ring where the pin is placed and the marke, the peece ſtanding at that direction, looke over the top of the Diſpart, from the

your thumb juſt under the ſtaffe of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, thruſt the ſame home to the Chamber of the Peece where the pouder lyeth, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ladle ſo, as your thumb be directly above the ſtaffe, and in ſo doing, the pouder will empty it ſelfe out of the Ladle cleanly, then drawing out your Ladle, with the Tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion at the other end of that ſtaffe, thruſt home the pouder, cauſing your aſſiſtant to hold his finger or thumb cloſe on the touch-hole, then taking a cloſe round wad of hey, or untwiſted rope, thruſt in the ſame with your Rammer head that is on the Spunge ſtaffe, (for if you ſhould doe it with that on the Ladle, it would ſoon looſen the plate of the Ladle) and with it give three or foure good ſtroaks, when you have thus done put in the bullet without any wad, becauſe the Peece muſt be elevated.</p>
                     <p>If you charge your peece with Cartred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which I count the beſt way; providing, (that although they hold the like quantity of powder) they be all of one thickneſſe; otherwiſe you ſhall finde much deceit in ſhooting: ſlit it a little in that place, which muſt be conveyed under the touch-hole; then put it home with the end of the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:38529:62"/>
and afterwards put home to it a good wad, then turn in the ſhot, the Peece being loaded, as I have taught you, take the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to the mark, by ſuch means as I teach in the 59 Chapter of this Book: and alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, how many degrees the platform, is either higher, or lower, then your marke with your Quadrant: after you have done thus; and calculated what degree you muſt mount the Gun unto, to reach the mark, if the ſaid mark be under the platform; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the profundity, out of the degrees of randon, but if the ſaid mark be higher then the platform, add the degree of that altitude, to the degrees of Random: and at theſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected degrees, mount your Peece: by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Ruler of the Quadrant into the mouth of your peece, marking diligently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the plumb-line, which proceedeth from the center of your Quadrant, cut thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and parts of a degree (unto which you are to mount the Gun) in the Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; Make your ſhot, for without queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, you may either ſtrike or come very neer the mark.</p>

416: one ſubtracted from the other the difference will be 46:404 differeth from 416 but 12 parts, which is a little above one quarter; ſo that your degree of Randon is foure and three quarters; or five lack one quarter; becauſe the mark is lower then the platform, ſubtract one degree and one ſixt part or ten minutes out of four degrees, and three quarters, or 45 minutes; and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayn is three degrees and 35 minutes, the true height, to which your peece muſt be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levated, to reach the mark.</p>
                     <p>If the ſhot graze either to the right or left, you are to mend it by the directions in <hi>Chap.</hi> 39, but if over, then you are to conſider the diſtance, how much it is beyond; and the next ſhot abate ſo many minutes out of your mountures, as the diſtance beyond the marke does require; if ſhort, you are to adde to your mounture, as if the like num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of paces that you ſhall finde ſhort, had been wanting to your diſtance, then proceed as before.</p>

                     <p>I Have diſcharged a peece ſeven times in the ſpace of 50 minutes, with the like weight of powder, ſhot, and elevation, and have found their ranges as following,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:38529:73"/>
the firſt ſhot was conveyed 416 paces, the ſecond 436, the third 440, the fourth 432, the fifth 425, the ſixth 410, the ſeventh 394, ſo that the greateſt difference from the firſt ſhot, was 24 paces, theſe things muſt be kept in perfect memory, by every one that learneth to ſhoot at randon, or he ſhall be never good at that practice. The reaſon of theſe things is this, at the firſt ſhot the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let found the aire quiet, and at the ſecond ſhoot, it did not onely finde the aire ſtirred with the firſt ſhoot, but alſo moving or ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding towards the place at which it ſhot, and becauſe it is more eaſie to move and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate that which is already moved and open, then that which is cloſe and quiet, it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the ſecond ſhot finding in his range a leſſe reſiſtance then the firſt did, will out-fly the firſt.</p>
                     <p>A ſecond reaſon is at the firſt ſhot the pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der being put in the peece, doth often times finde the ſame ſomwhat moyſt, eſpecially when it hath not been ſhot in for certain dayes before, through which the pouder will not fire quickly, as it doth when the peece is dry and temperately warme, for this warmth or heat will ſomwhat dry up
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:38529:73"/>
the moyſture which is in the powder, and cauſe it to fire ſooner; wherefore the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der doth not worke ſo forcibly in the firſt ſhoot as it doth in the ſecond, the third ſhoot and fourth will be much like the ſecond, now I will give you the reaſon, why as the peece grows hotter, one ſhot wil not out-shoot the laſt, before it, but every time come shorter and shorter.</p>
                     <p>The peece waxing hotter, and by how much the more hotter, by ſo much the more attractive is the concavity of the peece made, and becauſe the shot is driven forth, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled with no other thing then by the airy exhalation, or winde cauſed through the <hi>Salt peeter,</hi> therefore by making ſuch a peece the more attractive with the more heate, which ſuppeth and reteineth continually more and more of that winde, which should ſerve to expell the bullet, the vertue expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive in that peece, doth continually more and more decreaſe, and the shot flyeth not with that ſwiftneſſe as it did before; although the two firſt things, that is, the breaking of the aire, and the drying of the powder eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time more and more, doth help much the range of the shot, which aide and help, as it
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:38529:74"/>
is to be beleeved, that ſomtimes it ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and perchance gives advantage by that expulſive vertue, which continually the peece doth diminish, or ſup in according as it heateth, ſo that the third and fourth shoots will not be much differing from the ſecond shoot, nevertheleſſe in continuance of time, the ſaid two accidents (that is the opening of the aire and drying the powder by the heat of the peece) cannot ſupply the third acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that is, the vertue attractive, by reaſon the attraction is augmented as the peece heateth. This cauſed my ſixth and ſeventh shoots to convey the bullet 22 paces shorter then my firſt It is reported by <hi>Nicholas Tartaglia,</hi> that many shoots being made at a battery by a peece, it chanced by ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, that the peece roſe up in ſuch ſort that the mouth touched the ground, a little dog paſſing by, did ſmell unto the peeces mouth, and by ſo doing was faſt joyned to the peeces mouth, and immediately after drawn into the ſaid peece: which thing, when the ſtanders by had ſeen, ſome of them ran to helpe the ſaid dog, and although they found him to be drawn almoſt to the further end of the concavity, they pulled him out

Now to fill the Balloon place all your Serpents within it, together with Stars, Roc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets and Crackers, in ſuch a convenient man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that there may be very little void room, within the Cartouch: it being thus filled, put in as much powder duſt as you can that it may run every where thorow the chinks, between the Serpents, Rockets, and Stars, that they may all fire; and that the ſaid powder duſt may break the Balloon: theſe
